            <p>My journey started from a small town surrounded by mountains in the north of Italy, but I could not scratch off the sensation that I wanted to see what lies beyond those rocky giants. In short:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
              <li><span className="font-bold">Erasmus exchange</span> in Nijmegen (NL): my first experience abroad, sharing the flat and studies with people from all over the world. Intense and formative experience, it always has a special place in my memories</li>
              <li><span className="font-bold">Post-bachelor work experience</span> in Bonn (DE): the first work experience abroad, just for a few months.</li>
              <li><span className="font-bold">EIT Digital Master degree</span>: this was by far the most profound experience abroad, an improved version of the Erasmus exchange. The first year I had the pleasure to study at the excellent Aalto University nearby Helsinki (FI). The second year I completed my studies in Enschede (NL).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As you can see from the list above, I have been living, studying and sharing experiences with people from all over the world, so I understand cultural differences well. I have come to realise the importance of these experiences for my career, as they allowed me to adapt well in a multicultural team.</p>

            <p>Apart from building user interfaces, I also have other interests!</p>
            <ul className="list-inside space-y-4">
              <li><span className="font-bold">üé∏ Music</span>: In my teenage years I used to play the bass guitar in many local bands; unfortunately, that wasn't meant to become my career but I have fond memories of playing with my bandmates</li>
              <li><span className="font-bold">üèîÔ∏è Mountains</span>: I love to hike! I come from the Dolomites region, and I am always eager to go back whenever I can. Fate, ironically, decided I should live in the mountainless Netherlands..</li>
              <li><span className="font-bold">üçï Cooking</span>: I love to cook all sorts of Italian dishes and try new recipes from other cultures. I am fascinated by how one can use ingredients and combine them in novel ways, it's like culinary alchemy!</li>
              <li><span className="font-bold">üìñ Reading</span>: currently spanning to new areas where I am less comfortable (e.g. philosophy), I can't just have enough, I need to keep expanding my knowledge and have my ideas and values challenged.</li>
              <li><span className="font-bold">üåç Travel</span>: as almost everybody else, I want to discover new places and how differently people live compared to our culture. Last trip to Japan was one of my favourite ever, I loved how tradition and modernity are in such symbiosis.</li>
